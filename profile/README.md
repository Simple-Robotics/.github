# SimpleRobotics

This organization regroups open source software for efficient, frugal and reliable robotics.
It is supported by the [WILLOW](https://www.di.ens.fr/willow/) and [SIERRA](https://www.di.ens.fr/sierra/) teams at [Inria Paris](https://www.inria.fr/en).

If you are interested to use, deploy, extend, support or contribute to our software stack, feel-free to contact us.

## Current packages

- [**PyCppAD**](https://github.com/Simple-Robotics/pycppad) is an open source framework which provides bindings for the CppAD Automatic Differentiation([CppAD](https://coin-or.github.io/CppAD/doc/cppad.htm)) C++ library in Python. **PyCppAD** also includes support for the CppADCodeGen ([CppADCodeGen](https://github.com/joaoleal/CppADCodeGen)) library, which exploits CppAD functionality to perform code generation.

- [**ProxSuite**](https://github.com/Simple-Robotics/proxsuite) contains ProxQP, a generic purpose and efficient QP solver for robotics and beyond.

# SimpleRobotics

This organization regroups open-source software for efficient, frugal, and reliable robotics.
It is actively supported by the [WILLOW](https://www.di.ens.fr/willow/) and [SIERRA](https://www.di.ens.fr/sierra/) teams at [Inria Paris](https://www.inria.fr/en).

Please feel free to reach out to us if you want to use, deploy, extend, support, or contribute to our software stack.

## Current packages

- [**ProxSuite**](https://github.com/Simple-Robotics/proxsuite) provides ProxQP, a generic purpose and efficient QP solver for robotics and beyond, and QPLayer, an efficient solution for differentiating optimization layers depicted as QPs.

- [**ProxSuite-NLP**](https://github.com/Simple-Robotics/proxsuite-nlp), a primal-dual augmented Lagrangian solver for nonlinear programming on manifolds for robotics and beyond.

- [**Aligator**](https://github.com/Simple-Robotics/aligator), an efficient and versatile trajectory optimization library for robotics and beyond.

- [**PyCppAD**](https://github.com/Simple-Robotics/pycppad) is an open-source framework that provides bindings for the CppAD Automatic Differentiation([CppAD](https://coin-or.github.io/CppAD/doc/cppad.htm)) C++ library in Python. **PyCppAD** also includes support for the CppADCodeGen ([CppADCodeGen](https://github.com/joaoleal/CppADCodeGen)) library, which exploits CppAD functionality to perform code generation.
